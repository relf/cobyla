# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

* Remove `fmin_cobyla` implementation as `nlopt_cobyla` now renamed `minimize` based on NLopt implementation is more powerful
Nevertheless Cobyla argmin solver is still based on initial implementation, not on NLopt one.
* Remove gradient from `ObjFn` trait which is now renamed `Func`
* `minimize` API rework to make it more Rusty

## [0.4.0] - 2023-10-06

COBYLA implementation coming from the NLopt project is now also available (as `nlopt_cobyla`) allowing to compare 
with the initial implementation (`fmin_cobyla`). This new implementation went through the same process of using c2rust
transpilation from initial C implementation.

## [0.3.0] - 2023-01-28

COBYLA is now also implemented as an argmin::Solver to benefit from [argmin framework](https://github.com/argmin-rs) tooling. See [example](./examples/paraboloid.rs)

## [0.2.0] - 2023-01-09

COBYLA C code has been translated to Rust using [c2rust](https://github.com/immunant/c2rust) then manually edited.

## [0.1.0] - 2022-05-06

Rust wrapper for COBYLA optimizer (COBYLA stands for Constrained Optimization BY Linear Approximations). 
COBYLA C code was copied from [here](https://github.com/emmt/Algorithms/tree/master/cobyla) and wrapped 
using the callback trick implemented in [nlopt-rust](https://github.com/adwhit/rust-nlopt) project.
